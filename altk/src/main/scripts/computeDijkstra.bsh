/*
computes dijkstra for all nodes in graph. results returned in an arraylist. 
code has to live in a java class file and not here becase of the use of 
iterators (beanshell doesn't seem to handle generics or iterators)

executed java method will print results to beanshell instance and store
them in the form of an arraylist called dkResultAL.
