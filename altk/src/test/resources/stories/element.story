Narrative:
In order to define elements, the basic unit of being in alTk
As a development team
I want to define elements, the manner in which they are presented to the user, 
and a means of creating them. 

* all dorgs and environment constituents are types of elements 

* elements consist of a protocol, presence, and presentation. 

* presense is a collection of points between which lines are drawn. those lines 
have attributes associated with them that define how the world interacts with 
them. 

* presentation is simply the view presented to the user of that object. 

* the world itself is an element 

* crowd wisdom -- the phenomena where a large group of people can be asked a 
question like 'how many beans in this jar?' or 'how much does this cow weigh?'
and have the average of all the answers be pretty close to the actual answer. 
--this thing could potentially solve problems that way. 



// create an element
// define presentation
// define presence
// update presentation
// update presence 
// define protocol ** not applicable to non-creature **
// update protocol ** not applicable to non-creatures ** 
 
					 
Scenario: create an element
Given step represents a precondition to an event
When step represents the occurrence of the event
Then step represents the outcome of the event
